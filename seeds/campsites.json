The pretty beach is very long but narrow and will get very busy in the summer time. Nice views also looking back toward the mainland. Parking areas are also located to the left of the car park after approx 500m."

There are a couple of parking points that tolerate campers but they are too far out of Lisbon to make visiting easy and enjoyable. This car park is right on the marina, quiet location and only 2 km to centre. It is right in front of office buildings, so very quiet at weekends but you still have people walking around the marina, so not isolated. The police station is just around the corner. Difficult to get to just make sure you follow for the cruise terminal and stick to the port roads and not the main road in to Lisbon."
